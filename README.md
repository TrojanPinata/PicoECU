# Pico ECU

This is a repository hosting the code for a Pi Pico running as an ECU for a small 30cc EFI converted engine. There is likely no way for you to run this, but if you do for some reason need to, compile with the PicoSDK extension for VSCode and use that binary for the Pico. The schematic is provided, but this is a really finicky setup.
